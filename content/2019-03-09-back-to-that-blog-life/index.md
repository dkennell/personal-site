And so it begins. This is my second time starting a technical blog - the first one was mainly written to fill a requirement of my code bootcamp. A thrown-together, now-abandoned wordpress site where I never changed the default cover picture from a stock photo of a log cabin, I can't help but think 'good riddance' as I move onto something hopefully a bit more respectable.

I'm writing this site with Gatsby.js, which I first encountered right after graduating from the Flatiron school, my bootcamp. While looking for work, I lucked into a trial project for a west coast design firm where they would pay me for a week at contracting rates and then give me more work if it went well. At the time, it was decidedly out of my league - they wanted me to use Gatsby and to be honest, I had never even heard of static site generators before then. Needless to say, I botched the job and didn't get the gig. As stressful as it was, I actually found that I liked Gatsby a lot, and I knew I'd write a blog with it some day.

So a year and change later, here we are! I'm using a Gatsby starter (which is what the Gatsby community calls boilerplate) called gatsby-starter-developer-blog, created by Luigi Colella. So thanks, Luigi. My goal right now is to get up and running but as I continue to make use of this boilerplate, I looking forward to exploring it in a bit more depth and getting a betterunderstanding of how it works. Expect a few posts about that going forward.

A quick note about random placeholder posts you may see lying around - I tried removing them from the content directory earlier, but got errors when I tried to build the site. I'm leaving them for now so I can get a move on here. They're tied into something in the code base and I'm not sure what yet. I'll get them yanked out later, and I'll throw up a little post about it when I do. Woop.

What else to expect from this blog? Great question. So I've found that one of the trickest part of personal development as a dev is figuring out exactly what the hell to work on. Another todo list app? A shop for widgets? The thing is, if you're building an app just for the sake of having built an app... who really cares? How is that interesting to anyone? For an app to matter, the truth is that the development know-how must be married to knowledge of some other field - mathmatics, genetics, language, finance.

This puts me in a bit of a quandry in that I'm actually a rather clueless individual with little knowledge of anything.

...

So!

Where to go from here? After some consideration, I believe that the best move for me to make is to pick a heavily computerized field and plunge my face straight into it and learn everything.

So let's see...

How about... geography!

That was easy :)

I like maps and knowing where things are. And as a front-end dev, one of the things I need to know more about is data visualization. I can picture a ton of projects that I would have a blast with. Ooh, I think I want to make maps of moon craters. Or something.

Either way, that's gonna be my focus for the forseeable future. Expect a lot of posts that are basically just me jabbering about what I learned this week in terms of data visualization, digital cartography, or just geography in general.

More and more I believe that the coding gods favor devs who go into the weeds. And by that I mean, the ones who actually go deep into the business logic of things to really understand the domain they're working in. And sometimes if you want to do projects but you don't have an obvious field all set up for you, the thing to do is to just pick one, dive in and learn things like a person possesed. :D Wish me luck!
